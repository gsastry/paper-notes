# Title: Energy Efficient Computation via Qantal Synaptic Failures #
# Authors: William B Levy, Robert A Baxter# 

# Notes: #
- Key idea: this paper presents a model where the brain *requires* some synaptic
failures in order to be energy efficient.
- This seems to provide some evidence that the brain is near some sort of
pareto-optimal curve about tradeoffs: energy, information processing, what else?
- The crazy thing is that the brain is as capable as it is with ~10^14 synaptic
ops/s... and those synaptic ops seem to be low-bit (pretty noisy and fail, as 
in this paper)
